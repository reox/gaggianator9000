Expand the Feature of Gaggia Espresso Machine

Features i would like to implement:

* Preinfusion by switching pump and solenoid valve
* Analog Paddle (needs rotation pump...)
* Timer
* Temperature
* PID
* Menus for all kinds of stuff
* rotational encoder for control
* Measuring Power Consumption
* .... ALL the things!

Current Development
===================

... is done by using a arduino pro mini and 5V power supply which is hooked into the machine using 6.3mm Y taps
